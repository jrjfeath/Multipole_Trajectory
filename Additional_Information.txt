Ω = Σ + Λ
Σ is the spin angular projection, +/- S (spin angular momentum)
Λ is the electronic angular projection, +/- L (electronic angular momentum)

γ Cp/Cv, ratio of heat capacities, γ ~ 5/3 for atom and ~ 7/5 for diatom

--- Force of multipole with respect to position ---
Vstark = (μ) (Ecosθ_(μE)), first order stark interaction between molecule and field
Where θ_(μE) is the polar angle between the dipole and the electric field

In an ideal multipole the magnitude of the field at distance R is:
E = (-n)(V)((R**(n-1)) / (R0)**n)
R is the distance from the centre of the multipole
R0 is the radius of the multipole

Combining both equations gives:
F(R) = (μ) (cosθ_(μE)) (dE/dR)
Where <cosθ_(μE)> ~ ((ε|mΩ|) / (j(j+1)))
F(R) = (μ) ((-n(n-1)) (V) (R**(n-2))/R0**n) ((ε|mΩ|) / (j(j+1)))
Factoring out R allows for determination of force with respect to position

Beam density
https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4913251

#Angle of beam skimmer, ideally 40 - 60 degrees
#https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp201342u
#This should result in a FWHM ~ 10 degrees
#https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ac/2014/636042/
#A value of 0.2 is used to create a fine beam, much more representative of multipole
#but unrepresentative of actual conditions, easier to find best multipole conditions
