This feature optimizes the various lengths found in the experimental setup to 
find the maximum tranmission possible.

Running with fewer than 100 estimations leads to poor results

It will not change the distance between the skimmer and the multipole 
as this can be calculated by using the zone of silence.

It will vary the distance of each measurement  until it has scanned all
possible configurations. 

If search is being used the minimum and maximum estimated lengths should
be provided in the multipole section:
multipole:
  hexapole:
    size: 6           #Size of multipole, i.e hexapole = 6
    d0: 14            #Distance between rods (mm)
    lpole: 1650       #Length of multipole rods (mm)
    minp: 10          #Estimated shortest lpole (mm), see search info
    maxp: 2500        #Estimated longest lpole (mm), see search info
    ldist: 0          #Distance to the next multipole (mm)
    mind: 10          #Estimated shortest ldist (mm), see search info
    maxd: 2500        #Estimated longest ldist (mm), see search info
